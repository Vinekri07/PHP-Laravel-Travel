                <p>Mask covered faces, new stuff to add on in our backpack; masks and sanitizers. 
                    The spread of corona virus has unexpectedly dragged all ordinary life and travel life to a pause. 
                    I was scheduled to travel Sikkim in mid-may all of these got canceled. 
                    This is a snapshot of that day when I last traversed from Delhi to Ahmedabad.</p>
                    <p>I started marveling what to do now. And I began by watching many travel-related movies. I did a virtual tour of all my holidays and I end up writing about my journet, my adventures, and I have lots of untold travel stories from my journey over the years, and whatâ€™s better place than this to share my adventures.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here I am EXPLORING THE WHOLE NEW WORLD and hoping that this pandemic ends soon so that I can wander and bring you all along with me. 
                   </p><p>This is my story of how I jumped onto blogging.

                    Where ever you go in the mountains the thing which thrills you is Tea.
